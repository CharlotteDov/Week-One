Podcast and Readings:
-	I enjoyed the podcast and the whole idea of failing gloriously. I think that is something I have a hard time with because I am the type of person who feels accomplished through achieving good grades, which is fine, but I want to push myself out of my comfort zone and be more comfortable with the idea of failing 
-	Sharon Leon, 2016.‘Returning Women to the History of Digital History’ was very interesting. I am a female history student, so it was important to see this article and be reminded of the fact that even though I had never explored digital history before this class, the experiences of the women mentioned in the article are relatable to women in all sorts of disciplines. It also emphasized the idea mentioned in the podcast of being aware of our privilege and allowing others to fail safely. It is about allowing people from all backgrounds the chance to explore what digital history has to offer without judgement of their abilities. I know I was worried about this course because I am not remotely clued into the world of tech, but I can see through all the various platforms for communication that there are a lot of supports put in place so we can fail in a safe and supportive environment.

Hypothesis and Zotero:
-	I am putting these two together because they are both life-changing tools that I found easy enough to use
-	I thoroughly enjoyed exploring them and realizing just how helpful they will both be when it comes to doing researching and reading in the future
-	Zotero particularly will save me from doing all my citations for a paper an hour before its due. I know I will being getting a lot more out of this course, but honestly, learning about Zotero has made it already worthwhile

Github:
-	I have to admit this site confuses me, but between checking what people are posting on Github and googling, I think I am starting to understand. It will take some more playing around for sure

Asking for Help Exercise and Discord:
-	I was very grateful for Discord because when I read the asking for help prompt, I definitely overthought it. Before I even had the chance to ask for help, I opened it up and saw all the posts about it and they gave me a better understanding of the exercise
-	Seeing as I have never opened a command prompt before, I was a little nervous about the exercise, but I found a lot of great resources on google about the command prompt and also Github in general. All of which I could save on Zotero, which I absolutely love

Overall, I was anxious about this course and really did not know what to expect. I still don’t really know, but I feel supported and like I have the tools to get through.
