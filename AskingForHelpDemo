Demo Help Request:

Error with Committing Git Changes 
I was working on my repo and wanted to update it from the command line. 
I left it for a bit but when I came back, my computer had died. 
When I plugged it back in, none of my folders were open.
I clicked on one and opened a command prompt with the hope of committing my changes using this: 
git commit -m "this is just a test‚Äù. When I input that into the command prompt, I received this message:
![image i just uploaded](GitTest.png)  
I tried googling it but could not really find or at least understand what the issue was in this specific situation. Any help would be much appreciated!
