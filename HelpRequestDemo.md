Demo Help Request:

Error with Committing Git Changes 
	I was working on my repo and wanted to update it from the command line. I left it for a bit but when I came back, my computer had died. When I plugged it back in, none of my folders were open. I clicked on one and opened a command prompt with the hope of committing my changes using this: git commit -m "this is just a test‚Äù. When I input that into the command prompt, I received this message:
![github-test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64856056/81452962-5ce5cb00-9156-11ea-9d33-e1fac1aae9db.png)
I tried googling it but could not really find or at least understand what the issue was in this specific situation. Any help would be much appreciated!
